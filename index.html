      <p align="justify">The broad research objective for my current work lies in accelerating general purpose data parallel workloads on heterogeneous CPU/GPU architectures leveraging optimizations that exploit concurrency and optimize memory usage. The expected outcome would be a framework facilitating rapid development of data parallel applications by intelligent runtime scheduling of data parallel kernel DAGs on heterogeneous CPU/GPU platforms.
