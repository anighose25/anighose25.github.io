	<h1>Anirban Ghose | PhD Computer Science | IIT Kharagpur</h1>
	<p> I am currently in the fourth year of my PhD program under the supervision of Dr. Soumyajit Dey. My primary interests lie in designing Machine Learning assisted
	runtime systems for scheduling data parallel workloads on both heterogeneous clusters and embedded platforms. My research specifically 
	focuses on optimizing the execution of deep learning workloads on both cloud and edge devices using novel learning-aided scheduling solutions. 
	Before my PhD, I completed my M.S. from the same department where I worked on developing a task partitioning framework for OpenCL workloads.
	In the past, I have also worked on optimizing speech recognition systems using OpenMP and OpenCL.</p>
