<p align="justify">Did you know that the first instance of the "Hello World" program was implemented by Brian Kerningham as part of the documentation for the Basic Combined Programming Language (BCPL)?  BCPL was developed by Martin Richards at the University of Cambridge in 1967 and served as the basis for the B programming language which later evolved into the widely used C programming language. Since then, it has become a custom to use this as an introductory example program for learning any particular programming language, not to mention testing the first blog post here, because frankly this is best I could think of writing this moment. Hopefully, future posts would adhere to more relevant academic and technical content. </p>
